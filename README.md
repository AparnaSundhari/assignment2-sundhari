###### My Favorite place is Hyderabad

A major landmark of Hyderabad with four graceful **minarets** located in the old city. It was built by **Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah** as a memorial for plague victims. Charminar, on most occasions, is used to represent the city and the state and is hailed as a unique **Deccan** monument. It is in the midst of Charkaman which are four archways to roads leading in all four directions from the Charminar monument.Hyderbad is my birthplace, And I have many memories connected with hyderabad.
